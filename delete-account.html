<h2>Role-Based Account Deletion</h2>

    <strong>Delete Account</strong> option.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Imaam Accounts:</strong><br />
    Imaam accounts are created and managed by the application administrator.
    Account deletion for these users is handled by the admin upon request.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Admin Accounts:</strong><br />
    Admin accounts are internal system accounts created and managed by the developer and are not intended for public use.
    These accounts are deleted manually from the database when required.
